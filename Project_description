Background:
The general objectives of this BrainHack project is to use machine learning techniques to estimate the parameters of mathematical models.

Specific learning objectives and deliverables:
During the BrainHack school, I hope to achieve to following goals:

Linear Regression and Machine Learning:
Starting from a fictive equation and data simulated with the equation, test machine learning tools to find the weight of parameters for the linear model. For example:

f(t,u,v,w,x,y,z) = 2.1t + 3.6u + 2.8v + 5w + 1.4x - 2.5y + 4*z

f()=cognition

t=systolic blood pressure/140 | u=diastolic blood pressure/90 | v=glycosylated Hb/7 | w=age/70 | x=LDL/2 | y=years of education/12 | z=VS/20 |

Introduce noise to the simulated data.

Redo data simulation using a non-linear equation.

Use machine learning to solve this regression task

ODE parameter estimation and machine learning
Define a parameterized, ODE-based time series problem

Generate noisy training data from the ODEs

Use machine learning techniques to recover the original parameter estimates from the noisy data.
