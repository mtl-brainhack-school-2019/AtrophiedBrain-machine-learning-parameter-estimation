## Background
The general objectives of this BrainHack project is to use machine learning techniques to estimate the parameters of mathematical models.

## Specific learning objectives and deliverables
During the BrainHack school, I hope to achieve the following goals:

### Regression and machine learning

1) Starting from a fictive equation and data simulated with the equation, test machine learning tools to find the weight of parameters for the linear model.  For example:

   f(t,u,v,w,x,y,z) = 2.1*t + 3.6*u + 2.8*v + 5*w + 1.4*x - 2.5*y + 4*z
   
   f()=cognition
   
   t=systolic blood pressure/140 | u=diastolic blood pressure/90 | v=glycosylated Hb/7 | w=age/70 | x=LDL/2 | y=years of education/12 | z=VS/20 |   
   
2) Introduce noise to the simulated data.

3) Use machine learning to solve this regression task

### ODE parameter estimation and machine learning

1) Define a parameterized, ODE-based time series problem

dx/dt = a*x + b*(y + z)

dy/dt = a*y + b*(x + z)

dz/dt = a*z + b*(x + y)

Parameters: -1  	&#8804; a, b  	&#8804; 1 

2) Validate the model, investigating the identifiability of the parameters using Pydentify, which performs identifiability analysis by performing a Parameter Profile Analysis using COPASI (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8l00uU141o)

3) Generate noisy training data from the ODEs

4) Use machine learning techniques to recover the original parameter estimates from the noisy data.
